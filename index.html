<!-- My coding bootcamp training
After thorough reflections, I made a decision to join an immersive coding bootcamp at Coding Dojo. During 15 weeks of my bootcamp period, I intensively coded, searched, read, and coded more. It was such an incredible learning experience for me that I would love to join or organize an immersive coding training opportunity in the future. This is what my bootcamp experience looks like: -->
