Upon completion of a round, my system immediately recognizes and compensates the winner via Stripe, emphasizing the spirit of the sport and minimizing disputes. Through meticulous UX design, we achieved a streamlined single-page application, built on React's component-based architecture, ensuring both aesthetic appeal and optimal performance. On the server-side, Node.js plays a pivotal role, offering rapid data processing and swift user request responses. Moreover, the integration of Golf Course APIs provides users with invaluable course data, assisting in maintaining balanced and competitive games. The app boasts real-time features powered by Socket.io, permitting users to join games, place bets, and receive live score updates simultaneously. This, combined with MongoDB's intricate data models, allows for sophisticated operations and queries on user profiles, betting histories, and detailed game data. With React's modern capabilities, I adeptly employed Hooks and the Context API, paving the way for efficient state management and bolstered application performance.  <a href='https://www.allsquare.club'>www.allsquare.club</a>";
